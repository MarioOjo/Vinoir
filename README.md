## About The Project

Vinoir represents a collaborative effort to build a complete MERN stack e-commerce solution for a luxury perfume brand. The project addresses the challenge of creating an online shopping experience that balances aesthetic appeal with functional e-commerce requirements. In a competitive digital marketplace, luxury brands need platforms that reflect their premium positioning while providing seamless user journeys from discovery to purchase.

This application was developed as a summative group project to demonstrate full-stack development capabilities, including database design, API development, frontend architecture, and team collaboration using version control systems. The project showcases how modern web technologies can create immersive brand experiences that drive engagement and conversions.

**In 150 words or less**: Vinoir is a luxury perfume e-commerce platform built with the MERN stack that delivers a premium shopping experience. The application features a sophisticated product catalog, user authentication with innovative emoji-based security, shopping cart functionality, and responsive design. Developed collaboratively using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, it demonstrates full-stack development proficiency and modern web architecture. The platform balances aesthetic elegance with robust functionality, featuring product filtering, detailed item pages, and intuitive navigation. My contributions focused on establishing the foundational codebase, implementing the responsive homepage and product grid, and defining the cohesive visual design system that enabled efficient team development and a polished final product.

  const { wishlist, addToWishList, removeFromWishList } = useWishList();
  
  const handleAddToCart = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    e.stopPropagation();
    await addToCart({ ...product, quantity: 1 });
  };

  return (
    <Box component={Link} to={`/fragrance/${product.id}`}>
      {/* Product image, pricing, and interaction controls */}
    </Box>
  );
};
